## Description
As a bootcamp student, I want a professional portfolio to showcase my skills so that I have something to show potential employers. This portfolio will serve that purpose as it can be accessed from anywhere. I built this project to test my knowledge and skills using React. I learned more about how React routes work and relearned a lot about CSS and how it works with React.

## Installation
No installation required. Simply got to the website at https://andria-goodwin-portfolio.netlify.app/

## Usage
My portfolio feature an intuitive UI with navigation tabs. Simply click on the tab of the section you'd like to see and you will be routed there.

## Tests
I tested the application through trial and error.
