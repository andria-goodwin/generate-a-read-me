## Description
As a developer, I wanted a program to help me build a professional READ ME file for my projects. I built this project because it will help me build a READ ME file faster than before. Now all I have to do is answer questions that I already know about the project and the markdown file is automatically created. I learned more about node suring this project, specifically arrow functions and other ways to write more efficient code.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
You can use this application from the command line. You answer the prompts in the command line and the program automatically generates a markdown file using the information you entered. Here is a walkthrough video on how to use the Generate a READ ME application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWrfWp6wn_S4CkIv6qTxQ3wD7XMh7vMi/view

## Tests
The application was tested by running it and trying different combinations to ensure all functions were operating as they should.
